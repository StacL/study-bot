# Mock Interview Bot

## Optimize Practicing for Interviews
With a special focus on preparing for technical interviews, this bot will generate random coding-style questions from leetcode. With options to customize questions, your discord server members can add their own questions--technically related or not.

## Commands
- `$leetcode`: generate random question

- `$add` : add new question

- `$delete` : delete question by index

## Deployed Using Replit
See the replit code here: https://replit.com/@StacL/study-bot#main.py

**The code in this repo uses the repl.it database and repl.it secret keys. To deploy your own version, copy the repl.it and provide your own discord key.**
